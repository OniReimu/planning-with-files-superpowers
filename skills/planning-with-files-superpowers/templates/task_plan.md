# Task Plan: [Brief Description]
<!--
WHAT: This is your roadmap for the entire task (your working memory on disk).
WHY: After 50+ tool calls, goals drift. This file keeps goals + next actions visible.
WHEN: Create this FIRST. Update after each phase and after major decisions.
-->

## Goal
<!-- 
  WHAT: One clear sentence describing what you're trying to achieve.
  WHY: This is your north star. Re-reading this keeps you focused on the end state.
  EXAMPLE: "Create a Python CLI todo app with add, list, and delete functionality."
-->
[One sentence describing the end state]

## Canonical Plan (Optional)
<!--
If you have a canonical implementation plan (e.g. generated by Superpowers), link it here.
This plan is usually stable; this task_plan.md is the dynamic execution tracker.
-->
Canonical plan: [e.g. docs/plans/2026-01-09-my-feature.md | none]

## Next 1–3 Actions
<!--
Keep this tiny and concrete so you can resume quickly after context switches.
-->
1. [Next action]
2. [Next action]
3. [Next action]

## Current Phase
<!-- 
  WHAT: Which phase you're currently working on (e.g., "Phase 1", "Phase 3").
  WHY: Quick reference for where you are in the task. Update this as you progress.
-->
Phase 1

## Phases
<!-- 
  WHAT: Break your task into 3-7 logical phases. Each phase should be completable.
  WHY: Breaking work into phases prevents overwhelm and makes progress visible.
  WHEN: Update status after completing each phase: pending → in_progress → complete
-->

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
<!-- 
  WHAT: Understand what needs to be done and gather initial information.
  WHY: Starting without understanding leads to wasted effort. This phase prevents that.
-->
- [ ] Understand user intent
- [ ] Identify constraints and requirements
- [ ] Document findings in findings.md
- **Status:** in_progress
<!-- 
  STATUS VALUES:
  - pending: Not started yet
  - in_progress: Currently working on this
  - complete: Finished this phase
-->

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
<!-- 
  WHAT: Decide how you'll approach the problem and what structure you'll use.
  WHY: Good planning prevents rework. Document decisions so you remember why you chose them.
-->
- [ ] Define technical approach
- [ ] Create project structure if needed
- [ ] Document decisions with rationale
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 3: Implementation
<!-- 
  WHAT: Actually build/create/write the solution.
  WHY: This is where the work happens. Break into smaller sub-tasks if needed.
-->
- [ ] Execute the plan step by step
- [ ] Write code to files before executing
- [ ] Test incrementally
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification
<!-- 
  WHAT: Verify everything works and meets requirements.
  WHY: Catching issues early saves time. Document test results in progress.md.
-->
- [ ] Verify all requirements met
- [ ] Document test results in progress.md
- [ ] Fix any issues found
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 5: Delivery
<!-- 
  WHAT: Final review and handoff to user.
  WHY: Ensures nothing is forgotten and deliverables are complete.
-->
- [ ] Review all output files
- [ ] Ensure deliverables are complete
- [ ] Deliver to user
- **Status:** pending

## Key Questions
<!-- 
  WHAT: Important questions you need to answer during the task.
  WHY: These guide your research and decision-making. Answer them as you go.
  EXAMPLE: 
    1. Should tasks persist between sessions? (Yes - need file storage)
    2. What format for storing tasks? (JSON file)
-->
1. [Question to answer]
2. [Question to answer]

## Decisions Made
<!-- 
  WHAT: Technical and design decisions you've made, with the reasoning behind them.
  WHY: You'll forget why you made choices. This table helps you remember and justify decisions.
  WHEN: Update whenever you make a significant choice (technology, approach, structure).
  EXAMPLE:
    | Use JSON for storage | Simple, human-readable, built-in Python support |
-->
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
|          |           |

## Plan Deviations (If Canonical Plan Exists)
<!--
Purpose: Prevent “two sources of truth” confusion when executing against a canonical plan.

Rules:
- Minor deviation: safe/local change (small refactor, file path adjustment, extra test).
  → Log here and continue.
- Major deviation: changes the approach/architecture/algorithm or invalidates multiple planned tasks.
  → STOP and ask to update/replace the canonical plan (or explicitly approve the new direction).
-->
| Deviation | Severity (minor/major) | Rationale | Approved/Plan Updated? |
|----------|-------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|
|          | minor                   |           |                         |

## Errors Encountered
<!-- 
  WHAT: Every error you encounter, what attempt number it was, and how you resolved it.
  WHY: Logging errors prevents repeating the same mistakes. This is critical for learning.
  WHEN: Add immediately when an error occurs, even if you fix it quickly.
  EXAMPLE:
    | FileNotFoundError | 1 | Check if file exists, create empty list if not |
    | JSONDecodeError | 2 | Handle empty file case explicitly |
-->
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
|       | 1       |            |

## Notes
<!-- 
  REMINDERS:
  - Update phase status as you progress: pending → in_progress → complete
  - Re-read this plan before major decisions (attention manipulation)
  - Log ALL errors - they help avoid repetition
  - Never repeat a failed action - mutate your approach instead
